# JsonDiff

Allows you to deep-compare two JSON node trees and see the differences between them.

## Features

- Compare two JSON structures and get an enumerable of differences in the form of "extra/changed on left" and "extra/changed on right" entries.
- Supports nested JSON objects and arrays of any depth.
- Allows for comparison of shuffled arrays via custom array element key selectors, e.g. arrays of key/value pairs.
- Lightweight and (hopefully) fast.
- Open source and free to use.
- Comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and documentation of examples.
- Available on NuGet for easy integration into your projects.

## Supported platforms
